### Server Evolution Made Easy.

![Server Mechanic](https://server-mechanic.github.io/website/images/mechanic.png "Server Mechanic")

#### Evolve your containers and virtual machines more easily.

## Status

Still a prototype.

## Features

### Pros
* Evolve your servers step by step.
* Write server migrations in your favorite language.
* Focus on the migrations instead of developing reusable plugins.
* Minimal overhead, no central server required.

### Cons
* List of migrations can get very long for new installs. So it is well suited for virtual machines and containers you can take a full snapshot of.
